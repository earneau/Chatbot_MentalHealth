# Requirements

!pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
!pip install neattext
!pip install transformers

# GitIgnore

The gitignore file is a template used from the gitignore templates repository linked here : https://github.com/github/gitignore. The goal is to avoid uploading to and downloading from the github repository useless and heavy files such as the virtual environment. I personnaly added a line to avoid pushing recuring .DS_Store files.
